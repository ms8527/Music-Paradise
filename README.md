# Music-Paradise
1) Developed an application similar to Spotify which gave users a wide range of functionality
   like specifying personal taste of Music, finding a concert with respect to Music taste, place and time, 
   Finding a particular user and following him/her. 
2) Main goal is to provide an online service that offers information about band and concert, asking the user for the music it
   likes and then recommend the types of music that fits its criteria
3) In this user can also find information about the upcoming concerts of their favourite bands and
   also about the other bands.
4) Also a Recommender System was developed which gave options to users depending on his/her activity.
